# Data-Binding-Demo
New feature DataBinding is used in the project


I think it is time to get rid of findByViewId on Android, what 'bout you? We can hence use DataBinding which allows us to bind views in a simple way on Android. This is similar to Butter Knife but I guess, it is way comfortable to use and understand.

As for mentioning simply.

We add dataBinding block in build.gradle
We move our views into <layout> tags.
Build your project to let it Android generate required files
We declare ActivityDataBinding class and start binding views easily.
